This project uses `tq` (tiquette) for task tracking. Tickets live in `.tickets/` as markdown with YAML frontmatter.

Use `Bash(tq ...)` for work tracking instead of Todo*(...). Each `tq` call should be a separate Bash tool invocation.

Before starting multi-step work, check for existing tickets:
- `tq ls --ready` — actionable work
- `tq ls --blocked` — stuck work

If a matching ticket exists, use it. If not, create one. Trivial one-shot changes don't need a ticket.
